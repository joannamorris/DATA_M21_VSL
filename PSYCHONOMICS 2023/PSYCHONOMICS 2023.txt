INTRODUCTION
Statistical learning refers to the the mechanism by which we extract regular patterns from our sensory environment.  

Recognising visual patterns is a key component of many cognitive activities, and individuals differ in their sensitivity to these pattens (Misyak et al., 2010).

Reading words requires statistical learning in that readers must recognize letter patterns that frequently co-occur within words, such as affixes like  ‘pre-‘,  ’-ing’, and ‘-er’. 

Andrews & Lo (2013) found that skilled readers differ in terms of the extent to which they are sensitive to these sub-lexical orthographic patterns, (i.e. multi-character graphemes and affixes), and that this sensitivity influences the early stages of lexical retrieval.

Statistical learning has been show to facilitate reading ability in children (Arciuli & Simpson, 2012). But, do individual differences in statistical learning play a role in skilled reading? 

If so, to what extent are individual differences in sensitivity to sub-lexical orthographic patterns reflected in individual differences in brain responses to the statistical patterns in non-linguistic visual sequences?

METHODS
Following Andrews & Lo (2013, we used standardized scores on vocabulary and spelling tests as measures of semantic coherence and  orthographic precision respectively. 

Readers with better spelling than vocabulary were characterized as having an 'orthographic' reading profile.

Those with better vocabulary than spelling were characterized as having a 'semantic' profile.

Participants (n = 45) completed a visual statistical learning task consisting of an initial training phase and a subsequent test phase. 

In the training phase, participants viewed a series of unfamiliar shapes organized into triplets. Each triplet was presented 24 times during training. 

In a subsequent testing phase, on each trial participants saw two triplets—one that had been presented in the training phase and one unfamiliar triplet.

On each trial, they pressed a button to indicate whether the familiar triplet was presented first or second.  

As they completed the task we measured we measured the amplitude of the N400 component, a reflection of statistical learning (Abla et al., 2008; Abla & Okanoya, 2009).
